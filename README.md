GAME NOT FOUND! (TheHand Project)
Project Introduction

GAME NOT FOUND! is an action and fighting 2D Platformer game made by the TheHand team. The core idea is simple: You don't need a keyboard or mouse! You control the character using only your body movements, voice, and face expressions. This creates a super fun and healthy way to play, turning your real-life actions into game moves.
Core Concept: Natural Reaction

The game uses your Camera and Microphone for all interactions, challenging your natural reflexes:

    Voice Commands: Shout to use a strong skill, whisper to sneak, or use a keyword (like "henshin") to transform.

    Gesture Control: Swing your hands, move your feet, or hold specific poses (Pose Estimation) to attack, defend, or move your character.

    Face Expressions: Use Face Recognition to detect expressions (like smiling or opening your mouth wide) to unlock special skills or gain temporary power-ups (buffs).

Genre & Gameplay

    Genre: 2D Platformer, Fighting, Action.

    Gameplay: Control your character to fight and defeat enemies, where every move in the game comes from a real-life physical movement.

Technology Used

To make this unique control system work, the project uses specialized Machine Learning and Game Development tools:

    Game Engine: Pygame

    Gesture/Pose Analysis: Mediapipe (for Face, Handmark, and Pose Estimation)

    Voice Recognition: Moonshine ONNX
